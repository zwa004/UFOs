# Results

To use the website to find a triangle shaped UFO in Denver for May 3rd 2012, the users would enter the target date in the first blank, "CO" for State, "Denver" for City, "USA" for Country, and "triangle" for Shape. If the table shows no results then there aren't any of those type of sightings in that area on that date.

# Summary 

One drawback of this webpage is the syntax for searching. There are multiple types of date formats depending on the region of the world. Also, the engine is not sensitive to capitalized letters. 

## Recommendations

It is recommended that this page be restructured from a dynamic database instead of a static data folder so the results are as current as possible.

Also, it would be beneficial to have pages dedicated to summary, mission, search, etc. instead of all elements on a single page.
